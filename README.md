👋 Hi, I’m Mahmud

Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Data Analyst | Python Developer

I’m a data-driven problem solver building toward Machine Learning and AI engineering.
My focus is on clean Python code, solid mathematics, and practical data analysis — not shortcuts.

I enjoy breaking problems down, understanding algorithms from first principles, and turning messy data into useful insights.
